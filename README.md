# Tourism-Explorer-
India is famous for its tourism. It has all types of tourist places in one 
place. In India, one can discover massive mountain ranges, deserts, wild safaris, 
historical monuments, beaches, etc. Tourists from different states or countries 
need a system to help the tourists in their accommodation and tourist purposes. 
Thus, we are developing a web application that will provide necessary detailed 
description of the state tourists are visiting. The tourists will get knowledge about 
the state’s famous cuisines, best time to visit etc. The unique selling price of this 
project is that it has a Tourism module where the tourists can get knowledge 
about the famous sightseeing places of the state they are visiting. A location 
feature will be there which will help them to locate the place through Google 
Maps. Through our “Item Gallery”, the tourists can buy famous products of the 
desired state with few clicks! Our final module is an Online Hotel Booking, where 
the tourists can check out top 5 hotels of the area they are visiting and can easily 
book it with ease. This application will reduce the efforts of tourists to a greater 
extent. It is capable of boosting up the tourism sector too.
